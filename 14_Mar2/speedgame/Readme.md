# Exercise 24 - Speed Game (WIP)

Game where the user needs to click on the moving circule to score points.

It makes use of DOM manipulation methods, event listeners, functions, if/else statements.

* WIP = Work in progress
Currently most of the logic is visible through the console but still requires:
- time interval for switching the active circle
- visualizing the active circle in the page (not only in the console)
- Adjust the visual HTML elments to final colors and positions.
