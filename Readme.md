# JavaScript course exercises

This is a collection of JavaScripts exercises done during the React21K program, staring from the very basics of JavaScript to a team project.

** Please note that most projects are mostly contained in the JS files and should be checked in the browser console as nothing may be visible on the html file.

** If you wish to review the contents of the folders chronologically you can use the first number of the folder as a guide. E.g. 1_Task1 is the first folder, followed by 2_Task2, 3_jan_20, 4_Jan26, and so on.
